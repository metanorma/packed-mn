== Determination of defects

=== Principle

Extraneous matter, broken kernels, damaged kernels and other kinds of rice are separated manually according to the following types: husked rice, milled rice, husked parboiled rice and milled parboiled rice. Each type is then weighed.

=== Apparatus

The usual laboratory apparatus and, in particular, the following.

[%inline-header]
[[AnnexA-2-1]]
==== Sample divider,

consisting of a conical sample divider or multiple-slot sample divider with a distribution system, e.g. "Split-it-right" sample divider, such as that shown in <<figureA-1>>.

[%inline-header]
==== Sieve,

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.

[%inline-header]
==== Tweezers.

[%inline-header]
==== Scalpel.

[%inline-header]
==== Paintbrush.

[%inline-header]
[[AnnexA-2-6]]
==== Steel bowls,

of diameter 100 mm ± 5 mm; seven per test sample.

[%inline-header]
==== Balance,

which can be read to the nearest 0,01 g.

=== Sampling

See <<clause5>>.

=== Procedure

[[AnnexA-4-1]]
==== Preparation of test sample

Carefully mix the laboratory sample to make it as uniform as possible, then proceed to reduce it, using a divider (<<AnnexA-2-1>>), until a quantity of about 30 g is obtained.

All parts of kernels which get stuck in the perforations of a sieve should be considered to be retained by the sieve.

=== Determination

Weigh, to the nearest 0,1 g, one of the test samples obtained in accordance with <<AnnexA-4-1>> and separate the different defects into the bowls (<<AnnexA-2-6>>). When a kernel has several defects, classify it in the defect category for which the maximum permissible value is the lowest (see <<table1>>).

Weigh, to the nearest 0,01 g, the fractions so obtained.

=== Calculation

Express the mass fraction of each defect using <<formulaA-1>>:

[[formulaA-1,A.1]]
[stem]
++++
w = (m_D) / (m_s)
++++

where

stem:[w]:: is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample;
stem:[m_D]:: is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect;
stem:[m_S]:: is the mass, in grams, of the test sample.

=== Test report

Report the results as specified in <<clause7>>.
