[[paddy]]
=== paddy
alt:[paddy rice]
alt:[rough rice]

rice retaining its husk after threshing

[.source]
<<ISO7301,clause 3.1>>

[[husked_rice]]
=== husked rice
deprecated:[cargo rice]

_paddy_ (<<paddy>>) from which the husk only has been removed

[.source]
<<ISO7301,clause 3.2>>, The term "cargo rice" is shown as deprecated, and Note 1 to entry is not included here

=== milled rice
alt:[white rice]

_husked rice_ (<<husked_rice>>) from which almost all of the bran and embryo have been removed by milling

[.source]
<<ISO7301,clause 3.3>>

=== parboiled rice

rice whose starch has been fully gelatinized by soaking _paddy_ (<<paddy>>) rice or _husked rice_ (<<husked_rice>>) in water followed by a heat treatment and a drying process

=== waxy rice
variety of rice whose kernels have a white and opaque appearance

NOTE: The starch of waxy rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin. The kernels have a tendency to stick together after cooking.

=== extraneous matter
alt:[EM]
domain:[rice]

organic and inorganic components other than whole or broken kernels

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

[[HDK]]
=== HDK
alt:[heat-damaged kernel]

kernel, whole or broken, which has changed its normal colour as a result of heating

NOTE: This category includes whole or broken kernels that are yellow due to alteration. Parboiled rice in a batch of non-parboiled rice is also included in this category.

=== damaged kernel
kernel, whole or broken, showing obvious deterioration due to moisture, pests, disease or other causes, but excluding _HDK_ (<<HDK>>)

=== immature kernel
alt:[unripe kernel]

kernel, whole or broken, which is unripe and/or underdeveloped

=== husked rice yield
amount of husked rice obtained from paddy

// all terms and defs references are dated
[.source]
<<ISO6646,clause 3.1>>

=== nitrogen content
quantity of nitrogen determined after application of the procedure described

NOTE: It is expressed as a mass fraction of dry product, as a percentage.

[.source]
<<ISO20483,clause 3.1>>

=== crude protein content
quantity of crude protein obtained from the nitrogen content as determined by applying the specified method, calculated by multiplying this content by an appropriate factor depending on the type of cereal or pulse

NOTE: It is expressed as a mass fraction of dry product, as a percentage.

[.source]
<<ISO20483,clause 3.1>>

[[gelatinization]]
=== gelatinization
hydration process conferring the jelly-like state typical of the coagulated colloids, which are named gels, on kernels

NOTE: See <<figureC-1>>.

[.source]
<<ISO14864,clause 3.1>>

[[gel_state]]
=== gel state
condition reached as a consequence of _gelatinization_ (<<gelatinization>>), when the kernel is fully transparent and absolutely free from whitish and opaque granules after being pressed between two glass sheets

[.source]
<<ISO14864,clause 3.1>>

=== gelatinization time
stem:[t_90]

time necessary for 90 % of the kernels to pass from their natural state to the _gel state_ (<<gel_state>>)

[.source]
<<ISO14864,clause 3.1>>
